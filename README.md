# Android Interview Questions

This repository is intended to contain android interview questions I have faced over years, and also I like to ask myself to the candidates while I am interviewing any candidate. I would be naming a few companies for reference to give it more context but not to make it obvious. Interview questions do evolve and I would try to keep this repository as upto date as possible. In all answers you can find the links with the source of the answer, where you may read more detailed information on the question.
